# Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t , write a function to determine if t is an anagram of
s. 
[Anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram) is An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram itself can be rearranged into nag a ram, also the word binary into brainy and the word adobe into abode.



## Examples
### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```
## Constraints:
- **Note: 1**: You may assume the string contains only lowercase alphabets.
- **Note: 2**: `1 <= s.length`, `t.length <= 5 * 104`

Follow up: What if the inputs contain unicode characters? How would you adapt
your solution to such case?
