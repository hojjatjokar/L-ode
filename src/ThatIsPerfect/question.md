# That is Perfection

Write a program to determine whether a number **N** is equal to the sum of its
proper positive divisors(excluding number itself)

## Input Format

- First line: T(number of test cases)

### For each test case

- First line: n

## Output format

Print YESS if N is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors else print
NO.

## Constraints

- `1 <= T <= 100`
- `1 <= N <= 10^9`

## Sample input 1

```
3
6
5
28
```

## Sample output

```
YES
NO
YES
```

## Explanation

6 = 1 + 2 + 3, so it is perfect

5 != 1, so it is not perfect

28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14, so it is perfect
