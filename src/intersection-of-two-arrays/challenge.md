# Intersection of Two Arrays

Given two arrays, write a function to compute their intersection.

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.
## Examples
### Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Note:
```

## Notes
- Each element in the result must be unique.
- The result can be in any order.
